# Common Issues
*  Error Code: "'Response' object is not subscriptable" This is either due to your tokens being invalid/locked or your Proxies being dead. This is self explanatory and is not a proper issue with my code, but with the resources you are providing to the tool. Please come to me with an actual issue that deems the joiner of **not** working condition
